# 👋 Hi, I'm Ali Azlan

## 🚀 About Me

I am a **Full-Stack Web Developer & Cyber Security Specialist** with 5+ years of experience building fast, secure and maintainable websites and internal tools.

Most of my work is in **e-commerce** with **Shopify Plus**, **custom WordPress/WooCommerce builds** and modern JavaScript frameworks like **React** and **Next.js**. I also build custom apps and automation tools using **Python (Flask/FastAPI)** and **Node.js** with integrations to third party APIs.

I hold an MSc in **Cyber Security** and have hands-on experience with **SOC monitoring**, **SIEM (Splunk/Sentinel)**, **vulnerability management** and **CMS hardening**. That background helps me design and ship solutions with a **security-first mindset**, following good practices such as OWASP style checks and least privilege access.

I enjoy automation and DevOps work, using tools like **Docker**, **CI/CD pipelines** and cloud platforms such as **DigitalOcean**, **Render**, **AWS** and **Azure** to deploy stable projects for clients.

I also work as a **Top Rated Fiverr Seller** with 700+ 5★ reviews, delivering projects for clients in the UK, Europe, US and beyond.
