## 🚀 About Me

I'm a versatile Full-Stack Developer & Cyber Security Analyst with 5+ years of hands-on experience crafting scalable, secure, and high-converting web solutions.  
My specialty lies in **Shopify Plus**, **custom WordPress development**, and modern JavaScript frameworks like **React** and **Next.js**.

I’m also passionate about **automation and security**, often using **Python** with **Flask** and **FastAPI** to integrate APIs (Google, Twilio, GreenAPI, etc.), build intelligent assistants, scrapers, and workflow automation systems.  
On the security side, I have hands-on experience in **SOC monitoring**, **SIEM (Splunk/Sentinel)**, **vulnerability management**, and **CMS hardening**, ensuring every project follows a **security-first approach**.

Focused on creating full-stack solutions with a **security-first mindset** and **automation** at their core.
